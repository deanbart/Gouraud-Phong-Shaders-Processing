# Gouraud-Phong-Shaders-Processing

Note: In order to use this code, import the respective PEasy Cam and Control P5 libraries.

This program utilizes a 3D model object to compare the differences between the Gouraud and Phong Shaders (using GLSL).
The 3D environment implements 2 different 'Spotlight' light sources which can be manipulated to rotate around the model.
Spotlights can be controlled according to their concentration (amount of light produced) and their cut-off (angle of emission).

Attached images can be found demonstrating the code in action
